    description: "Set up the backend server using Express.js. Implement RESTful routes for task management (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE, PATCH). Configure essential middleware including express.json for parsing JSON payloads and cors for handling cross-origin requests. Add custom middleware for input validation to ensure all tasks are created and updated with clean, valid data. Connect the backend to an in-memory database represented by a JavaScript array. This task ensures the project has a reliable backend foundation that follows best practices.",

    description: "Develop the React frontend application. Create modular components including TaskForm for adding tasks, TaskList for displaying tasks, TaskItem for individual task details and actions, and TaskFilter for filtering tasks by status. Connect these components to the backend API via a dedicated services layer that handles fetch calls. Ensure state management with useState and side effects with useEffect are implemented correctly. This task delivers a complete UI that allows end-to-end task management with a clean structure.",
